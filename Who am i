  <h2>1. My name is Mark Adrian Balabal, I’m 22 years old and I recently graduated from Wesleyan University- Philippines with a B.A. in Political Science. While there, I learned a lot of theory in subjects like corporate communication, international economics, corporate governance, and more. I was also part of the student government, and maintained a GPA of 3.6. I’ve worked hard in my education and now I’m ready to apply my knowledge into practice.While I don’t have any real-life work experience, I’ve had a lot of exposure to the political environment .Now, I’m looking to leverage everything I’ve learned in college and get some hands-on work experience</h2>
